# ebrius

## Alcohol is timeless. So are bespoke creations. Luckily we blended the two together so it always goes down smooth. ebrius utilizes the untapped potential of the up and coming cocktail culture so that mixologist can share their creations the same way virtually every other form of media is able to. Drinking will never be antiquated, so neither should the drinks. Now, every concievible cocktail is at your slowly numbing fingertips. With ebrius, a posh cocktail designed in LA can be enjoyed by everyone from your regional oligarchs to your local gutter punks. Feeling creative? Craft and share your own personal drinks or menus for bragging rights or perhaps a job offer. Either way, you will be significantly more "educated" every time you stop by.
