# Eggshell & Beige

## Eggshell & Beige (working title) allows a user to create an account, login and then input a list of ingredients, spices, and or appliances you have and pull a list of recipes from an api that you can use. Ideally, the application will have an option for you to display recipes with ingredients you don't have as long as you specify. Search filters will include cooking times, appliances, quantities etc etc. furthermore users will be able to submit their own recipes they have that other users can do a simple up vote or down vote. these recipes can be featured on the front page. We hope to have a substitution filter as well (i.e. if a recipe calls for olive oil and all you have is butter it will substitute and adjust cooking times) similar apps out there are ugly and non user friendly so with the right branding we are pretty much gonna be rich.

- whats the purpose of our app?

  - wanting to provide a place that makes it easy for people with limited time and energy, or those who don't want to waste food and utilize the ingredients that they already have in order to make a potentially quick and easy meal?

- what are some of the key features we want to implement?

  - how would we implement those?
  - how about necessary APIs and technology?
  - is there a way to implement the ability to filter recipes by they skill level it takes to cook or perhaps even the amount of time that it takes to prepare something.

- when you get on the app/site how about a greeting animation similar to whats done on hulu?

- there needs to be a way to make an account and a reason to make an account

  - Login/make an account in order to save individual recipes
  - by making an account you can search recipes by ingredients in your cupboards

- API's
  - need to find an api that is free to use, and that allows us to search for individual items on so we can compare ingredients we have with ingredients that we may need
