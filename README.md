# Eggshell & Beige

## Eggshell & Beige (working title) allows a user to create an account, login and then input a list of ingredients, spices, and or appliances you have and pull a list of recipes from an api that you can use. Ideally, the application will have an option for you to display recipes with ingredients you don't have as long as you specify. Search filters will include cooking times, appliances, quantities etc etc. furthermore users will be able to submit their own recipes they have that other users can do a simple up vote or down vote. these recipes can be featured on the front page. We hope to have a substitution filter as well (i.e. if a recipe calls for olive oil and all you have is butter it will substitute and adjust cooking times) similar apps out there are ugly and non user friendly so with the right branding we are pretty much gonna be rich.
