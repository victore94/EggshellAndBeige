# ebrius

Alcohol is timeless. So are bespoke creations. Luckily we blended the two together so it always goes down smooth. Ebrius utilizes the untapped potential of the up and coming cocktail culture so that hobbyists or mixologists can share and test and rate new or revised cocktails easily. Drinking will never be antiquated, so the drinks shouldn't have to be either. Now, every conceivable cocktail is at your slowly numbing fingertips. With Ebrius, a posh cocktail designed in LA can be enjoyed by everyone from your regional oligarch in his ivory tower, to your local tinsmith with holes in his boots. Feeling creative? Craft and share your own drink recipes and add them to your menu for bragging rights or perhaps a job offer. Either way, you will be significantly more "educated" every time you stop by.
