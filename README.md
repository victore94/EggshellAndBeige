# iNebriated

## Bartender culture is everywhere, and so are bespoke creations. Luckily we blended the two together so it always goes down smooth. iNebriated utilizes the untapped potential of the up and coming mexology world so that mixologist can share their creations the same way virtually every other form of media is able to. Drinking will never be antiquated, so neither should be their creators. With iNebriated, a posh drink designed in LA can be enjoyed by everyone from oligarchs to sewer rats. Feeling creative? are you a caged bird? A starving libiral arts major? Well get ready to spit shine those glasses because you ARE relavent the world is ready to taste what you have to mix.
