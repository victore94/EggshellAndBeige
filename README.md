# Eggshell & Beige

## Eggshell & Beige (working title) allows a user to create an account, login and then input a list of ingredients, spices, and or appliances you have and pull a list of recipes from an api that you can use. Ideally, the application will have an option for you to display recipes with ingredients you don't have as long as you specify. Search filters will include cooking times, appliances, quantities etc etc. furthermore users will be able to submit their own recipes they have that other users can do a simple up vote or down vote. these recipes can be featured on the front page. We hope to have a substitution filter as well (i.e. if a recipe calls for olive oil and all you have is butter it will substitute and adjust cooking times) similar apps out there are ugly and non user friendly so with the right branding we are pretty much gonna be rich.

- whats the purpose of our app?

  - wanting to provide a place that makes it easy for people with limited time and energy, or those who don't want to waste food and utilize the ingredients that they already have in order to make a potentially quick and easy meal?

- what are some of the key features we want to implement?

  - how would we implement those?
  - how about necessary APIs and technology?
  - is there a way to implement the ability to filter recipes by they skill level it takes to cook or perhaps even the amount of time that it takes to prepare something.

- when you get on the app/site how about a greeting animation similar to whats done on hulu?

- there needs to be a way to make an account and a reason to make an account

  - Login/make an account in order to save individual recipes
  - by making an account you can search recipes by ingredients in your cupboards

- API's
  - need to find an api that is free to use, and that allows us to search for individual items on so we can compare ingredients we have with ingredients that we may need

# iNebriated

## Bartender culture is everywhere, and so are bespoke creations. Luckily we blended the two together so it always goes down smooth. iNebriated utilizes the untapped potential of the up and coming mexology world so that mixologist can share their creations the same way virtually every other form of media is able to. Drinking will never be antiquated, so neither should their creators. With iNebriated, a posh drink designed in LA can be enjoyed by everyone from oligarchs to sewer rats. Feeling creative? are you a caged bird? A starving libiral arts major? Well get ready to spit shine those glasses because you ARE relavent the world is ready to taste what you have to mix.

# Purpose

## We've all seen mixology competitions in the fringes of our youtube recommendations, but whether it's a redbull sponsored event, or some obscure dive bar whose walls are lined with old boots, nothing is yet standardized for one of the most standard and ancient tradition for virtually every human on earth...or at least, you know, the cool ones. New drinks are being mixed up every day in every part of the world and the last thing we want you to do is choke down one more blue label. Instead, give us a list of any consumable beverage in your house, and we will give you drink options from people relatively more crafty than you. That is unless of course you are a stallion behind the bar. If that is the case, its not even true until you prove it to countless strangers. How? Use our simple rating system to see how you measure up to every other self titled hotshot with a distracting facial piercing. Your parents may not understand you, but odds are someone on iNebriated will. Craft and share your own personal menu for bragging rights or job offers. Either way, you will be an exponentially smarter drinker every time you stop by.
